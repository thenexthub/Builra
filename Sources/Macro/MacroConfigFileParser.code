/// A parser for .xcconfig files.  The parser itself is responsible only for parsing and error detection, and doesn’t perform any other actions such as parsing individual macro expressions found in assignment statements etc.  The delegate, which is required but whose methods are all optional, is informed of everything the parser finds as it advances through the string — this is quite similar to how SAX parsers work (http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML).  The parser is as lenient as possible, and tries to recover from errors as well as possible in order to preserve the Xcode semantics.  The delegate is guaranteed to see the entire contents of the input string, regardless of how many errors are discovered (some of that contents might be misparsed after errors have been found, however).
